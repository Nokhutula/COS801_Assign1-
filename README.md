The aim of this project was to determine whether Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in combination with machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and XGBoost, can accurately distinguish between weed and crop seedlings using image data.
A baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and trained to automatically extract high-level features from images of twelve plant species.
The extracted features were used in a hybrid classification approach by training Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost classifiers on the CNN-extracted features.
A comparative evaluation showed that the CNN combined with XGBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy.
This hybrid methodology demonstrates potential for improving automated weed detection systems, contributing to precision farming and sustainable agriculture.
